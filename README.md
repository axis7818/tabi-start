## Development

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [tabi](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/). It was forked from [tabi-start](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start).

### 1. Clone the Repository

The tabi theme is included as a git submodule.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/axis7818/axis7818.github.io
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install Zola

```sh
# on macOS
brew install zola

# on windows
winget install getzola.zola
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```sh
zola serve
```
